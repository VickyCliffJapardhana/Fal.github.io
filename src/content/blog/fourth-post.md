OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a technology that enables computers to read text from images or scanned documents.

Example use cases:

- Scanning ID cards
- Scanning shopping receipts
- Scanning PDF documents
- Detecting vehicle license plate numbers

## How It Works

In general, the process includes:

1. Image preprocessing
2. Grayscale conversion
3. Noise reduction
4. Thresholding
5. Text detection
6. Character segmentation
7. Pattern recognition (ML / AI)

## Tools & Libraries

1. Tesseract OCR  
   Plus points:
   - Open source
   - Uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
   - Supports output formats (PDF, HOCR/HTML, etc.)
   - Multi-language support

2. Google Vision API
   - Handles complex document formats
   - Cloud-based AI
   - Supports handwriting recognition

3. OpenAI Vision / Modern AI OCR
   - Reads text
   - Understands context
   - Extracts structured data

## Challenges

- Handwriting is difficult to detect accurately
- Blurry or unclear images
- Poor lighting conditions
- Complex layouts

## Real-World Use Cases

- e-KYC (identity verification)
- Automated ID card scanning
- POS systems for receipt scanning
- Archive digitalization
